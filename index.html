    <h3 i="headline">Here's a time line of Prof. Alan Turing's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1912</strong> - Born on June 23 in Maida Vale, London.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1931</strong> - Studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1936</strong> - Traveled to United States of America. He studied mathematics and cryptology at Princeton University.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1939</strong> - At the end of that year. Alan Turing helps to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1940</strong> - He was responsible for creating the Bombe at Bletchley Park. This machine was used to codebreak nazi codes during World World II.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1942</strong> - He returned to United States to collaborate with the US naval cryptanalysts to create the american version of the Bombe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1946</strong> - He presented his paper, which was the first design of a stored-program computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1947</strong> - Lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of Automatic Computing Engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1948</strong> - Created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations. Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1950</strong> - The Turing test was created in 1950. The Turing test was created to compare the intelligence of a computer to the intelligence of a human brain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1952</strong> - Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis"
       was published in 1952 which was all about his interest in the biology of organisms. This year was convicted for indecency and is forced to undergo hormone treatment to suppress his homosexuality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1954</strong> - Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him dead.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="headline">Post-mortem honors:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>2009</strong> - British government apologizes to Alan Turing and vindicates his role in history.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2013</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II grants him a royal pardon.
      </li>
    </ul>

        "It's no exaggeration to say that, without Alan Turing's outstanding contribution, the history of World War Two could well have been very different. So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work, I'm very proud to say: we're sorry. You deserved so much better. "
